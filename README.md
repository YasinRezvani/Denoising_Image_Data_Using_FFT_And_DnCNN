# Denoising_Image_Data_Using_FFT_And_DnCNN
This project explores various techniques for enhancing image quality and reducing noise in digital images. The focus is on comparing the effectiveness of two different approaches: FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) filters and DnCNN (Denoising Convolutional Neural Network) denoising.
